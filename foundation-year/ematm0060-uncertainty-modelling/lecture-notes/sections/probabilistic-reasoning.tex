\section{Probabilistic reasoning}

Classical logic is based on propositions and rules that are known with
certainty.
This is generally impossible.
Probabilistic reasoning is based on uncertain knowledge.
There are generally multiple probability distributions that are consistent with
a knowledge-base.
