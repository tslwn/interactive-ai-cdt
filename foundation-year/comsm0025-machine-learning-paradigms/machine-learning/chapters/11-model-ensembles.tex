\section{Model ensembles}

An ensemble is a combination of models.
Ensembles often outperform other methods at the expense of increased
complexity.
Model combination is motivated by computational learning theory and statistics.
In statistics, an average of measurements can produce more reliable estimates
because it reduces the influence of noise.
An ensemble of models should be diverse, e.g., trained on subsets of the data
or features.
