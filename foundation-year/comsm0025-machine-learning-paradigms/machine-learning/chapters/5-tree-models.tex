\paragraph{Trees}

A tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph.
A rooted tree is a tree in which a node is designated the root.
The edges of a rooted tree may be directed away from or towards the root.
The nodes of an $m$-ary tree have at most $m$ children.

\paragraph{Tree models}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textit{tree model} is represented by a directed rooted tree.
        The branch nodes represent features and the leaf nodes represent instance space segments.
  \item A \textit{feature tree} is represented by a binary directed rooted tree.
        There are two edges directed away from each branch node, each of which represents a mutually exclusive proposition about the value of the feature.
  \item A \textit{decision tree} is represented by an $m$-ary directed rooted tree where $m \geq 2$.
        There are $m_i$ edges directed away from each branch node $i$, each of which represents a possible value of the feature.
\end{itemize}

TODO:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Disjunctive normal form
  \item Distributive equivalence $A \vee (B \wedge C) \equiv (A \vee B) \wedge (A \vee C)$
  \item De Morgan laws $\neg (A \vee B) \equiv \neg A \wedge \neg B$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Expressivity}

A decision tree represents a set of mutually exclusive logical expressions, which can be written in different equivalent forms.
The expressions represented by a decision tree may not be equivalent to \textit{conjunctive} expressions of individual features\footnote{But they may be equivalent to conjunctive expressions of \textit{conjunctive features}. This is called \textit{constructive induction}.}.
Because any logical expression may be written in disjunctive normal form, decision trees are maximally \textit{expressive}, i.e., they can separate any data that is consistently labelled.

However, expressive hypothesis languages are prone to overfitting and one way to prevent overfitting is to choose a restrictive hypothesis language.
Learning algorithms in expressive hypothesis spaces typically have an \textit{inductive bias} towards simpler hypotheses, either implicitly by the search procedure or explicitly by a term in the loss function.

\paragraph{Bias and variance}

Low-bias models are more likely to overfit to the training data.
Low-variance models change by a small amount when the training data changes by a
small amount.

Low-variance, high-bias models are preferable when there is limited training
data and overfitting is a concern.
High-variance, low-bias models are preferable when there is plenty of training
data but underfitting is a concern.

\paragraph{Learning algorithms}

A feature tree represents conjunctive concepts in the hypothesis space.
The learning problem is to choose the best conjunctive concepts to solve a task.

Algorithm~\ref{algLearnFeatureTree} (pseudo-code) is a generic learning procedure.
It is a \textit{divide-and-conquer} algorithm: it splits the data into subsets, learns a tree for each subset, and combines them.
It is also a \textit{greedy} algorithm: it always chooses the best feature values to split the data at a given step, which may be sub-optimal.
An optimal but more computationally expensive alternative is to search for the best feature values to split the data over all steps.

% TODO: Update from exercises.
\begin{alg}
  \label{algLearnFeatureTree}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]

  # Returns true if data can be given a single label.
  def is_homogeneous(data)

  # Returns the best label for data.
  def label(data)

  # Returns the best feature values to split data.
  def find_feature_values(data, features)

  # Returns the subsets of data for each feature value.
  def find_split(data, feature, values)

  def grow(tree, data, features):
    if is_homogeneous(data):
      tree.add_leaf(label(data))

    feature, values = find_feature_values(data, features)

    for subset in find_split(data, feature, values):
      if len(subset) > 0:
        grow(tree[feature], subset, features)
      else:
        tree[feature].add_leaf(label(subset))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{alg}

\subsection{Decision trees}

\subsubsection{Purity of a leaf}

For a classification task, a set of instances is \textit{homogeneous} if the instances belong to the same class.
Therefore, \lstinline[language=Python]{def label} returns the majority class.
The \textit{purity} of a set of instances is the proportion of instances that belong to the majority class.
It is proportional to the \textit{empirical probability} $\dot{p}$.

\subsubsection{Impurity of a leaf}

\lstinline[language=Python]{def find_feature_values} returns the feature values that maximise the purity (minimise the impurity) of the subsets.
In terms of $\dot{p}$, the impurity $f$ must obey the following constraints:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $f(\dot{p}) = 0$ : $\dot{p} \in {0, 1}$, i.e., it is zero if the subset is homogeneous
  \item $f(\dot{p}) = f(1 - \dot{p})$, i.e., it is symmetric about $\dot{p} = \frac{1}{2}$
  \item $\argmax_{\dot{p}} f = \frac{1}{2}$, i.e., it is maximal when $\dot{p} = \frac{1}{2}$
\end{itemize}
Some examples of impurity functions are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Minority class} $\min(\dot{p}, 1 - \dot{p})$

        The error rate, i.e., the proportion of instances that are labelled incorrectly if they are labelled with the majority class.

  \item \textit{Gini index} $2 \dot{p} (1 - \dot{p})$

        The expected error if we label instances randomly.

  \item \textit{Entropy} $- \dot{p} \log_2 \dot{p} - (1 - \dot{p}) \log_2 (1 - \dot{p})$

        The expected number of bits encoded by the class of a random instance.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Impurity of a tree}

The impurity of a set of mutually exclusive leaves, i.e., a decision tree, is the weighted average of the impurities of the leaves:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqnImpurityTree}
  f(\{ D_i \mid i \in 1, ..., n \}) = \frac{1}{|D|} \sum_{i = 1}^n |D_i| f(\dot{p}_i)
\end{equation}

For binary classification, we can find $f(\{ D_+, D_- \})$ from $f(\dot{p}_+)$ and $f(\dot{p}_-)$ geometrically:
First, we draw a straight line between $(\dot{p}_+, f(\dot{p}_+))$ and $(\dot{p}_-, f(\dot{p}_-))$.
The line represents the possible weighted averages of $f(\dot{p}_+)$ and $f(\dot{p}_-)$.
Given that $\dot{p} = \frac{|D_+|}{|D|} \dot{p}_+ + \frac{|D_-|}{|D|} \dot{p}_-$, $f(\dot{p})$ is the point on the line that corresponds to $\dot{p}$.

\subsubsection{Multi-class classification}

Impurity functions can be generalized to $k > 2$ classes, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{$k$-class Gini index} $\sum_{i = 1}^k \dot{p_i} (1 - \dot{p_i})$
  \item \textit{$k$-class entropy} $\sum_{i = 1}^k - \dot{p_i} \log_2 \dot{p_i}$
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Purity and information gain}

To split a parent node $D$ into children $\{ D_i \mid i = 1, ..., n \}$, we typically choose the feature that maximises the \textit{purity gain}:
\begin{equation}
  f(D) - f(\{ D_i \mid i = 1, ..., n \})
\end{equation}
If $f(D)$ is the entropy, this is called the \textit{information gain}.
It measures the increase in information about the class gained by including the feature.
A `best split' algorithm finds the feature that minimises $f(\{ D_i \mid i = 1, ..., n \})$.

\subsection{Ranking and probability estimation trees}

A grouping classifier can be used to rank instances by learning an ordering on its instance-space segments.
Decision trees can access the class distributions (empirical probabilities) of the segments, from which an ordering can be derived that is optimal for the training data.
This is not possible for some other grouping classifiers.

The ordering is optimal because it produces a convex ROC curve.
The ROC curve is convex because its segments are sorted in decreasing order of slope.
The slope of a segment is $\frac{\dot{p}}{1 - \dot{p}}$ and, because the slope is a monotonic function of $\dot{p}$, sorting the segments in decreasing order of $\dot{p}$ is equivalent to sorting them in decreasing order of slope.

The empirical probability of a parent node is a weighted average of the empirical probabilities of its children (see \ref{eqnImpurityTree}):
\begin{equation}
  \dot{p} =  \frac{1}{|D|} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} |D_i| \dot{p}_i
\end{equation}
But this does not constrain the empirical probabilities of a parent's children, so we cannot find the ordering of segments from the tree structure.

TODO:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Interpretation of splits in terms of coverage curves.
        To add a split: split the line segment of the ROC curve into $k > 2$ segments and re-sort the segments in decreasing order of slope.
        Sorting the segments ensures that the ROC curve is convex.
  \item Turning a feature tree into a decision tree (classifier), ranking tree, or probability estimation tree.
  \item[] \begin{itemize}
          \item Decision tree (classifier): choose the operating conditions and find the optimal point under those conditions.
          \item Ranking tree: order the segments in decreasing order of empirical probability.
          \item Probability estimation tree: predict the empirical probabilities of the segments (applying smoothing).
        \end{itemize}
  \item Pruning trees.
  \item[] \begin{itemize}
          \item Merging all leaves in a subtree
          \item Only recommended for classification and when you can define the operating conditions
          \item E.g., reduced-error pruning with a pruning set
          \item Never improves accuracy over the training data
        \end{itemize}
  \item Sensitivity to imbalanced classes.
  \item[] \begin{itemize}
          \item Oversampling the minority class.
                Applies to any model without changing the model itself.
                But increases training time and may not change the model(!).
        \end{itemize}
  \item Relative impurity.
  \item[] \begin{itemize}
          \item The relative impurity of a child node is its weighted impurity in proportion to its parent node's impurity.
          \item Some impurity measures are invariant with respect to the class distribution.
                E.g., the square root of the Gini index, which minimises the relative impurity.
          \item Impurity measures that vary with the class distribution produce splitting criteria that emphasise child nodes with more instances.
                E.g., the Gini index and entropy.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

How to train a decision tree:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prioritise ranking performance
  \item Use an impurity measure that is invariant with respect to the class distribution.
        Otherwise, oversample the minority class to balance the class distribution.
  \item Apply Laplace or add-$k$ smoothing to the empirical probabilities.
  \item Given the operating conditions, select the best operating point on the ROC curve.
  \item Optionally, prune subtrees whose leaves are homogeneous.
\end{enumerate}
